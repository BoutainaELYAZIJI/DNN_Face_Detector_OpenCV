# Face Recognition With OpenCv & Python Using DNN : 


May 04, 2022 by : Boutaina Elyaziji & Mohamed Amchia 


# Introduction :


Face recognition has always been one of the most searched and popular applications of object detection, starting from the early seventies. 
Facial recognition is used for access control, authentication, fraud detection, surveillance, and by individuals to unlock their devices.


The frontal face can be easily detected, but multi-view face detection remains a difficult task, due to various factors like illumination, various poses, occlusions, and facial expressions. 

We propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based approach to improve the accuracy of detection of the face. We show that Deep Neural Networks algorithms have better accuracy than traditional face detection algorithms for multi-view face detection.

The Deep Neural Network (DNN) gives more precise and accurate results, as the DNN model is trained with large datasets and the model learns the best features from the dataset.



# ðŸ’» Deep Neural Network:


The deep neural network (e.g., DNN) is an artificial neural network (e.g., ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers that allow to learn the features that optimally represent the given training data.


## :exclamation: Installing OpenCV :

<p>First of all make sure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it using pip:</p>

> * pip install opencv-python
	

<p>When using OpenCVâ€™s deep neural network module with Caffe models, youâ€™ll need two sets of files:</p>
* The .prototxt file(s) which define the model architecture (i.e., the layers themselves)</br>
* The .caffemodel file which contains the weights for the actual layers

#  :point_right: Pre-requisites :
1. python compiler & IDE 
2. A working webcam
3. OpenCV installed
4. The Caffe prototxt files for Deep learning face detection
5. The Caffe weight files for Deep learning face detection
